#traditional power analysis for incremental prediction
I conclude from the result of a traditional power analysis for incremental prediction that a sample size of at least *N* = 75 is needed to ensure that my analysis has a power of .85 for detecting an increment in variance (ie., agreeableness will uniquely predict 10% of the variance in performance scores when in a regression with conscientiousness).
